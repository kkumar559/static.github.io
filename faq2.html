                        The risk of catching COVID-19 from the feces of an infected person
                       appears to be low. While initial investigations suggest the virus may
                       be present in feces in some cases, spread through this route is not a 
                       main feature of the outbreak. The ongoing research on the ways
                       COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share new findings. Because
                       this is a risk, however, it is another reason to clean hands regularly,
                       after using the bathroom and before eating.

                        <p>
                            The risk depends on where you are - and more specifically, whether
                            there is a COVID-19 outbreak unfolding there.
                            For most people in most locations the risk of catching COVID-19 is
                            still low. However, there are now places around the world (cities or
                            areas) where the disease is spreading. For people living in, or visiting,
                            these areas the risk of catching COVID-19 is higher. Governments
                            and health authorities are taking vigorous action every time a new
                            case of COVID-19 is identified. Be sure to comply with any local
                            restrictions on travel, movement or large gatherings. Cooperating with
                            disease control efforts will reduce your risk of catching or spreading
                            COVID-19. <br>
                            COVID-19 outbreaks can be contained and transmission stopped, as
                            has been shown in China and some other countries. Unfortunately,
                            new outbreaks can emerge rapidly. Itâ€™s important to be aware of the
                            situation where you are or intend to go.

                            Illness due to COVID-19 infection is generally mild, especially for
                            children and young adults. However, it can cause serious illness:
                            about 1 in every 5 people who catch it need hospital care. It is
                            therefore quite normal for people to worry about how the COVID-19
                            outbreak will affect them and their loved ones.<br>

                            We can channel our concerns into actions to protect ourselves, our
                            loved ones and our communities. First and foremost among these
                            actions is regular and thorough hand-washing and good respiratory
                            hygiene. Secondly, keep informed and follow the advice of the local
                            health authorities including any restrictions put in place on travel,
                            movement and gatherings.

                            While we are still learning about how COVID-2019 affects people,
                            older persons and persons with pre-existing medical conditions (such
                            as high blood pressure, heart disease, lung disease, cancer or
                            diabetes) appear to develop serious illness more often than others.

                        <p>
                            No. Antibiotics do not work against viruses, they only work on
                            bacterial infections. COVID-19 is caused by a virus, so antibiotics do
                            not work. Antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or
                            treatment of COVID-19. They should only be used as directed by a
                            physician to treat a bacterial infection.

                            While some western, traditional or home remedies may provide
                            comfort and alleviate symptoms of COVID-19, there is no evidence
                            that current medicine can prevent or cure the disease. We do not
                            recommend self-medication with any medicines, including antibiotics,
                            as a prevention or cure for COVID-19. However, there are several
                            ongoing clinical trials that include both western and traditional
                            medicines. We will continue to provide updated information as soon
