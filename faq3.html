                    <p>
                        Not yet. To date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine
                        to prevent or treat COVID-2019. However, those affected should
                        receive care to relieve symptoms. People with serious illness should
                        be hospitalized. Most patients recover thanks to supportive care.<br>
                        Possible vaccines and some specific drug treatments are under
                        investigation. They are being tested through clinical trials. <br>
                        The most effective ways to protect yourself and others against
                        COVID-19 are to frequently clean your hands, cover your cough with
                        the bend of elbow or tissue, and maintain a distance of at least 1
                        meter (3 feet) from people who are coughing or sneezing

                            No. The virus that causes COVID-19 and the one that caused the
                            outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003 are
                            related to each other genetically, but the diseases they cause are
                            quite different. <br>
                            SARS was more deadly but much less infectious than COVID-19.
                            There have been no outbreaks of SARS anywhere in the world since
                            2003.

                        <p>
                            Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially
coughing) or looking after someone who may have COVID-19.
Disposable face mask can only be used once. If you are not ill or
looking after someone who is ill then you are wasting a mask. There is
a world-wide shortage of masks, so We urge people to use masks
wisely.<br>
We advises rational use of medical masks to avoid unnecessary
wastage of precious resources and mis-use of masks The most
effective ways to protect yourself and others against COVID-19 are to
frequently clean your hands, cover your cough with the bend of elbow
or tissue and maintain a distance of at least 1 meter (3 feet) from
people who are coughing or sneezing.

                            The “incubation period” means the time between catching the virus
and beginning to have symptoms of the disease. Most estimates of
the incubation period for COVID-19 range from 1-14 days, most
commonly around five days. These estimates will be updated as more
data become available.

                            Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in
                            animals. Occasionally, people get infected with these viruses which 
                            may then spread to other people. For example, SARS-CoV was
                            associated with civet cats and MERS-CoV is transmitted by
                            dromedary camels. Possible animal sources of COVID-19 have not
                            yet been confirmed. <br>

                            To protect yourself, such as when visiting live animal markets, avoid
direct contact with animals and surfaces in contact with animals.
Ensure good food safety practices at all times. Handle raw meat, milk
or animal organs with care to avoid contamination of uncooked foods
and avoid consuming raw or undercooked animal products.

                            While there has been one instance of a dog being infected in Hong
Kong, to date, there is no evidence that a dog, cat or any pet can
transmit COVID-19. COVID-19 is mainly spread through droplets
produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or speaks. To
protect yourself, clean your hands frequently and thoroughly. <br>

We continues to monitor the latest research on this and other COVID19 topics and will update as new findings are available.
